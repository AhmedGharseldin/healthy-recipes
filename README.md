# healthy-recipes

This is a simple website dedicated for healthy recipes, impleting the basics of html I learned thus far. 

Foundation skills to be reflected in this project:

1. Creating new repos on github and clonning the project locally
2. creating index.html and with the basic boilerplate
3. index.html to include elements such as <p>, <strong>, <em>, <a>, <img> along with some basic attributes.

I am excited to how this website will look at the end of this foundation course.
